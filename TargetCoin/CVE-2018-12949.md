
### Target Coin (TGT) 
 https://etherscan.io/address/0xac3da587eac229c9896d919abc235ca4fd7f72c1#code


```javascript

    function mintToken(address target, uint256 mintedAmount) onlyOwner {
        balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;
        totalSupply += mintedAmount;
        Transfer(0, this, mintedAmount);
        Transfer(this, target, mintedAmount);
    }

```

In function mintToken(),the Target Coin (TGT) token could be minted by itâ€™s administrator arbitrarily. The balanceOf[target] and mintedAmount are defined as uint256, so Operator '+' would trigger a integer overflow by a crafted value of mintedAmount.

Simulated In Remix:

Administrator can mint a arbitrary mount of tokens to a target account , for example 0x8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Wei:

Next step , Administrator mint a crafted amount(0x8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000) of token to a target account , trigger a integer overflow :

And now the balance of target account overflow to be zero.

what's more , there is a overflow with "totalSupply += mintedAmount" , then Administrator could create more coins than they predetermined.

And actually the Administrator could control the target account's balance to be an arbitrary value.
